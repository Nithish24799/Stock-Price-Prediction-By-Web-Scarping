Stock Price Prediction with Web Scraping and Python

This repository contains Python code for predicting stock prices using web scraping techniques. By scraping historical stock data from a website (in this case, Yahoo Finance), preprocessing the data, and training a machine learning model, you can predict future stock prices based on past trends.

Introduction

Stock price prediction is a challenging but essential task for investors and traders. Predicting stock prices accurately can help individuals make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding stocks. Web scraping allows us to gather historical stock data from online sources, which can then be used to train machine learning models for prediction.

In this project, we scrape historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using Python's BeautifulSoup library. We preprocess the scraped data, create relevant features such as moving averages and Relative Strength Index (RSI), and train a Random Forest regressor model for prediction.
